## What "Visual Cookiecutter" is?

Visual Cookiecutter is a small Python package which lets the developers 
instanciate (or bake) `cookiecutter` templates in a snap! With its sleek and 
modern interface built on top of `streamlit`, Visual Cookiecutter provides a fresh 
and intuitive user experience.

Say goodbye to the tedious process of filling up `cookiecutter` parameters data 
through a terminal and hello to a visually appealing frontend that will make 
template instantiation a breeze. Our software is designed to seamlessly integrate 
with `cookiecutter`, so all cookiecutter templates work out-of-the-box. See the 
example below with [cookiecutter datascience](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science).
